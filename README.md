# CS110-Assignment-Trie-Trees

Implemented a **trie tree** and used this to:
* Analyse the complexity of the tree.
* Print a dictionary in alphabetical order.
* Find the **k most common words** in a speech (also using heaps).
* Implement an **autocomplete algorithm** with a Shakespearean dictionary (finds the most common word to which the input is a prefix).
